# CS2401 - Introduction to Computer Science II
These are the notable assignments from CS2401 (Summer 2020)

This class was a continuation of CS2400 basically, so more introductory object-oriented programming using C++

The main topics we covered included linked lists, stacks, queues, class inheritance, makefiles, recursion, and binary trees

The final project was to make a single player game of Othello/Reversi where a user plays against the computer (final product is in Week 7/6C_Project)
