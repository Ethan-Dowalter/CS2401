/******************************************************************
     This is the main that drives your lab. You will need to construct the
     four classes which are used in it. (Shape, Circle, Rectangle, 
     Trapezoid.) This lab provides the concepts that you will be using
     in your Project 5, but there are imporant differences, such as the 
     use of the list class, the need for output functions, and no 
     requirement that there be a cost for the homes.
